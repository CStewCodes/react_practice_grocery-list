# Music Playlist -- Full-Stack React 

This was an minimum viable project (MVP) for a class project in Galvanize: Operation Level UP's program. 

### Requirements
- Create a RESTful application
- Create, Read, and Destroy routes, Update optional. 

### Constraints
- Two days to create
- First MVP in React


### Notes

I wanted to create something that was true to a MVP idea, giving me the chance to really learn how to make something using the React library. 

A user can add a song name, artist, and album to the list, or delete it. In both instances, we are updating the front end and the database so they match.

For future updates:
- update a song
- link to Spotify for listening
- login functionality
